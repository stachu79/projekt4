### Executive summary

#### Scope and assumptions

This document is a summary of work proceeded by Group od SDA. The main subject of the tests were to obtain root privileges. The test focuses on security issues leading to compromise victim's machine.
The machine exists as a virtual machine, which can be accessed from [this link](https://tryhackme.com/room/psychobreak)
The tests were carried out by using whitebox.

### Risk classification

Vulnerabilities are classified in a five-point scale reflecting both the probability of exploitation of the
vulnerability and the business risk of its exploitation. Below is a short description of meaning of each
of severity levels.

- CRITICAL - exploitation of the vulnerability makes it possible to compromise the server
    or network device or makes it possible to access (in read and/or write mode) to data with
    a high degree of confidentiality and significance. The exploitation is usually
    straightforward, i.e. the attacker need not gain access to systems that are difficult to
    achieve and need not perform any kind of social engineering. Vulnerabilities marked
    CRITICAL must be fixed without delay, especially if they occur in production environment.
- HIGH - exploitation of the vulnerability makes it possible to access sensitive data (similar
    to CRITICAL level), however the prerequisites for the attack (e.g. possession of a user
    account in an internal system) makes it slightly less likely. Alternatively: the vulnerability
    is easy to exploit but the effects are somehow limited.
- MEDIUM - exploitation of the vulnerability might depend on external factors (e.g.
    convincing the user to click on a hyperlink) or other conditions that are difficult to achieve.
    Furthermore, exploitation of the vulnerability usually allows access only to a limited set of
    data or to data of a lesser degree of significance.
- LOW - the exploitation of the vulnerability results in little direct impact on the security of
    the application or depends on conditions that are very difficult to achieve practically (e.g.
    physical access to the server).
- INFO - issues marked as INFO are not security vulnerabilities per se. They aim to point
    out good practices, whose implementation will result in increase of general security level
    of the system. Alternatively: the issues point out some solutions in the system (e.g. from
    an architectural perspective) that might limit the negative effects of other vulnerabilities.

### Change history

2023-05-07 version 1.0 Final version of the report after carried tests out.

### Process of exploiting machine

#### Summary

During the process some technics were used to get finnaly root privileges. Despite docker technology was used, root privileges has been gain as a result of misconfiguration, poorly password protection and use of documented vulnerability. Methods and technics were used:
-port scanning
-webapp attacks
-code injection
-pivoting
-exploitation
-password cracking
-brute forcing

#### Prerequisites for the attack

Local internet access - Victim's IP Address: 10.10.42.81

#### Technical details (Proof of concept)

First of all we needed to discover services at victim's machine

#### Recommendation

- don't leave fragile comments in HTML code
- set up web server to avoid shell injection
- avoid setting up crontab with higher privileges than necessary
